# Business-Analysis-Agent

Intelligent AI Agent that can answer questions about your database, search competitor news, and generate reports with strategic insights from them. Additionally, users can upload their own PDFs, and the agent will answer questions based on the content of those files (RAG).


At the heart of this setup is a single AI agent with access to three powerful tools:

🗃️ SQL Tool, to answer questions by querying a MySQL database.

🌐 Web Search Tool, powered by Tavily, to fetch up-to-date insights (e.g., competitor news).

📄 RAG Tool (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), to answer questions based on the user's uploaded PDFs.
